Forming a successful FLL (FIRST Lego League) team requires a combination of dedicated individuals, clear goals, and a supportive environment. The foundation of the team is built on shared values and a commitment to learning and collaboration.

You can also use this guide to induct any new team members and incorporate them into the existing team.

## Hiring

**1. Skillset:** Look for individuals with a mix of technical and non-technical skills. While knowledge in robotics and programming is essential, soft skills like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving are equally important.

**2. Passion for STEM:** A genuine interest in science, technology, engineering, and math will drive team members to invest time and effort into their projects.

**3. Diversity:** A diverse team brings different perspectives, ideas, and solutions to the table. Consider diversity in terms of gender, age, background, and experience.

**4. Previous Experience:** While not a necessity, having team members with prior FLL or robotics experience can be beneficial. They can provide insights, mentor newer members, and help navigate challenges.

Sometimes you have to build a flyer and send out flyers to attract interested candidates. Also, you can have a Google Forms sign-up sheet and ask questions about what kind of skill sets and experience they are bringing to the table.

## Setting expectations

**1. Commitment:** Every team member should understand the time and effort required. Regular meetings, practice sessions, and competitions can be time-consuming.

**2. Collaboration:** Emphasize the importance of teamwork. Every member's input is valuable, and decisions should be made collectively.

**3. Continuous Learning:** Mistakes and failures are part of the learning process. Encourage a growth mindset where team members view challenges as opportunities to learn and grow.

**4. Respect:** Foster an environment where every team member feels valued and heard. Respect for each other's ideas and opinions is crucial.

## Team size

The ideal team size for FLL is between 5 to 10 members. This size ensures that every member has a role and can contribute effectively. Too few members might lead to an overwhelming workload, while too many can lead to coordination challenges and members feeling left out.

## Roles

**1. Team Captain:** Leads the team, ensures that everyone is on track, and acts as the primary spokesperson during competitions.

**2. Robot Designer:** Focuses on the design and construction of the robot, ensuring it's optimized for the challenges.

**3. Programmer:** Responsible for coding the robot's actions using the LEGO MINDSTORMS software or other compatible platforms.

**4. Researcher:** Delves into the annual FLL theme, gathers relevant information, and helps the team develop a project related to the theme.

**5. Strategist:** Analyzes the game board, identifies the most valuable missions, and helps plan the robot's actions during the competition.

**6. Presenter:** Takes the lead in presenting the team's project during competitions, ensuring the message is clear and engaging.

**7. Documenter:** Keeps track of the team's progress, decisions, and iterations. This role is crucial for reflecting on the team's journey and for preparing the engineering notebook or any other required documentation.

**8. Mentor/Coach:** An adult or experienced individual who guides the team, provides insights, and ensures the team stays on track. They also handle logistics like registering for competitions and organizing travel.

Remember, roles can be fluid, and team members can wear multiple hats. The key is to ensure everyone has a clear understanding of their responsibilities and feels empowered to contribute to the team's success.

## Ice Breakers and Team Building Games

Building a cohesive and collaborative FLL team requires more than just technical skills. It's essential to foster a sense of camaraderie and trust among team members. Ice breakers and team-building games can help break down barriers, encourage communication, and create a positive team environment.

### Ice Breakers

**1. Two Truths and a Lie:** Each member shares two true facts about themselves and one false one. The rest of the team tries to guess which one is the lie.

**2. LEGO Story:** Provide each member with a few random LEGO pieces. Ask them to build something in a short time (e.g., 5 minutes) and then share a story about their creation.

**3. Name Bingo:** Create bingo cards with different characteristics or experiences (e.g., "Has been to a robotics competition before", "Loves to code", "Has a pet dog"). Team members mingle and try to find people who match the descriptions to fill their card.

### Team Building Games

**1. Blindfolded LEGO Build:** In pairs, one person is blindfolded and tries to build a specific LEGO structure while the other person gives verbal instructions without touching the LEGO pieces.

**2. Human Knot:** Team members stand in a circle, reach out, and grab two different hands from people across the circle. The challenge is to untangle the knot without letting go of the hands.

**3. Robot Relay:** Set up a simple obstacle course. Team members must guide a robot through the course, but each person can only control the robot for a short distance before passing the controls to the next member.

**4. Tower Challenge:** Using only a set amount of materials (e.g., LEGO bricks, paper, tape), teams compete to build the tallest tower in a limited time.

**5. Problem-Solving Scenarios:** Present the team with a hypothetical FLL-related challenge (e.g., a malfunctioning robot or a disagreement about strategy). Have them discuss and come up with solutions collaboratively.

Incorporating these activities into your team's routine, especially in the early stages, can help members get to know each other better, understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, and work more effectively as a unit.
