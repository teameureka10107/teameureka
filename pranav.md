It's Pranav Maheshwaran, your friendly neighborhood sixth-grade [STEAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEAM_fields) student, and a hardcore robotics aficionado. I wear many hats, not the least of which is the cap of a founding member, chief problem solver, and primary innovation wizard for the famous Team Eureka 51206, which competes fiercely in the Lego jungle of the First Lego League (FLL). Our creative engines churn out ingenious projects that tackle real-world problems, from championing physical exercise to fine-tuning delivery bots and extending a robotic hand to disaster-struck regions. Our techno-magic has even launched us into the FIRST World Championship in Houston, a feat that fuels my pride and dreams.

From the moment I got my first LEGO brick and flirted with the charming MINDSTORMS, I've clocked over **3500 hours** on FLL-specific missions, and a **whopping 7000 hours** (since my LEGO initiation) getting my hands dirty with system beauties like EV3, Spike, and Robot Inventor.

Architectural marvels and mammoth LEGO constructions? Count me in! My brick portfolio boasts the mighty Colosseum and the majestic UCS Millennium Falcon. I've also got my fingers well-oiled in assembling the tricky LEGO TECHNIC models, including the mighty Lego Liebherr, the high-flying Lego Rough Terrain Crane, and the earth-munching Lego Bucketwheel Excavator.

When I'm not lost in my LEGO wonderland, I play the mentor role, passing the LEGO torch to budding FLL teams and hopeful enthusiasts. In tandem, I've mastered the art of 3D printing models for my playful obsessions, and have explored the digital blueprint realms of TinkerCAD, AutoCAD, and BrickLink Studio. Electronics, you ask? That's another feather in my cap, honed for my innovative projects.

My LEGO passion and unwavering commitment to my team have earned me some sparkling medals at the Qualifiers and Regionals, including the coveted Champion’s 1st Place and dual honors of 1st and 3rd places in Robot Design in the State Festival. My MOC (My Own Creation) exploits run the gamut from robotic arms, Rough Terrain Explorers, auto-defense turrets to full-blown battleships, with my 6ft pride and joy – the replica of the IJN Yamato being the crown jewel.
